# AscentAgain
AscentAgain Web Application for HackViolet's Hackathon
Our Website is specifically aimed towards women in distress, to help them with questions like "What next?", "Where do I go from here on?", "How do I cope with this colossal amount of stress?", "How do I take care of myself and my family now?" 

To answer these questions, we have services that help search jobs, seek therapy and a forum to discuss issues and share stories/experiences. Along with these, our website also provides some general yet lesser-known facts about female empowerment laws in India and women helpline numbers. We have taken four cities into consideration namely Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore and have used real-time data.

*Database files would be required for the smooth working of the project. Please include the database file hackvioletdatabase.sql.*
